I set out to create a web page to similate a page where users can buy new and used games. 

## Description
This is a project I created as a student at Noroff. It is my very first attempt at creating a website using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. It is a project I have worked on in stages: 1) designing in Figma 2) build it with HTML and CSS 3) add functionality with Javasciprt and fetch data from API call rather than hardcoded. 


- This is to show case skills I have writing Javascipt to make API calls and also how to code up functionality of a web page. 
- This is also an example of how I can type up and use HTML and CSS to create a functional website. In addition it showcase skills I have in   using CSS to make a website userfriendly and accesable to people. 
- List item 3
